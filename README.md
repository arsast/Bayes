### EM algorithm for Image Reconstruction

Here, we have 3-dimensional data array `CameraData.npy` (provided upon request) which represent the sequence of images (~video stream) with an extra incorporated (same) image into each picture but with a different position. The stream is corrupted by a noise.

So, the overall purpose is to reconstruct confidently both images using the Bayes approach and EM-algorithm.

The proposed model description and its implementation are inside.
